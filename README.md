# 👋 Hi, I'm Siddharth Dhanasekar!

I'm a Computer Engineering student at Georgia Tech (🇺🇸 U.S. Citizen), passionate about building software and AI systems that push the boundaries of innovation — from deepfake detection to quantum-safe encryption. I’ve had the opportunity to lead engineering projects, found an EdTech startup, and conduct impactful research at top institutions like Stanford and West Chester University.
